From GTi manual

Looking at female RJ-12 socket on the mount:
   ____
---    ---
| 654321 |
----------

1 blue   N.C.
2 yellow TX       (3.3V) (mount receives)
3 green  Vpp+     ( 12V)
4 red    RX       (3.3V) (mount sends)
5 black  GND
6 white  Reserved (3.3V)

RX/TX roles on the mount are swapped and
actually indicate RX/TX on remote end

Another way to test is to connect to the mount using a terminal program
9600,8,n,1 and type:

:e1

Typing these three characters plus a ENTER or CTRL-M "\r" should
echo typed ":e1\r" and produce the response "=0210A\r" from the mount.

=0210A

The working serial cable connects using these parameters:
Baud rate 9600
Data bits=8, Stop bits=1, Parity=None
Set chars: Eof=0x00, Error=0x00, Break=0x00, Event=0x00, Xon=0x11, Xoff=0x13
Handflow: ControlHandShake=(), FlowReplace=(XOFF_CONTINUE), XonLimit=2048, XoffLimit=512
