[x] swap tx/rx pins on RJ-12 connector for default UART2
[ ] upload to mip install
[ ] bluetooth joystick key remap to fit synscan pro
    if setup right then joystick hat can drive axis even if
    touchscreen cursors are not displayed (this is how
    darfon joystick on wire works)
[ ] the comm is still not smooth, often times joystick is like
    "kept pressed" even after user has released it, goto position
    is paused and resumed and similar
[ ] stability, esp32 comm sometimes gets stuck and needs reboot
[ ] reconnectability, many retries needed
    after few connect/disconnects esp32 is stuck and needs reboot
    in this state esp32 doesn't respond to socat command from PC
    but works after reboot
[ ] esp32 bluetooth access to joystick so it can work
    independet of synscan
[ ] pic of the PCB
[ ] schematics maybe UTF-8 block art
